# Dependency Manager Enhancements
This project contains some fixes and enhancements done on the Apache Felix Dependency Manager.
It also provides a TODO section which need to be addressed before doing the release.

# How to build and test
if you are using a corporate http proxy, export the following variable:
```sh
$ export GRADLE_OPTS="-Dhttp.proxyHost=<your proxy ip> -Dhttp.proxyPort=<your proxy port> -Dhttps.proxyHost=<your proxy ip> -Dhttps.proxyPort=<your proxy port>"
```
then type:
```sh
$ gradlew gradlew org.apache.felix.dependencymanager.annotation:jar
$ gradlew jar
$ gradlew check
```
# New features and enhancements
The following improvements have been done:
- annotation API has been simplified
- support for user-defined configuration types (annotations)
- DM API has been reworked to simplify definition of aspect and adapters.
- Support for OSGI service scopes
- The dependency manager is now built using bndtools 3.5.0 as well as latest bndlib 3.5.0

# Javadocs
You can find the javadoc for the new annotation API in `./javadocs/annotation`
and the enhanced (compatible) api in `./javadocs/api`

## Annotations enhancements
Essentially, the following enhancements and modifications have been done:
- added support for new user defined property type annotations (similar to OSGI R7).
- annotations using standard r7 @ComponentPropertyType are also supported. Indeed, not only declarative service is using this annotation, other r7 apis like jaxrs whiteboard are also defining some annotations that are themselves annotated with @ComponentPropertyType; so it is important to support this annotation (The dm annotation plugin has been enhanced by reusing some part of the ds annotation scanner from bndlib, which is full of reusable useful code which has been applied to dm (scanning of property types, PREFIX_, etc ...)
- Allow ServiceDependency to auto detect the service type when the annotation is applied on a collection class field
- removed FactoryComponentAdapterService (some attributes have been added in the Component annotation in order to declare factory pid components with the @Component annotation)
- removed some old annotations / attributes. The attributes and annotations related to metatype have been removed since you can now use the standard metatype annotations.  if users need to old version, then they can simply use the previous 4.2.1 from [old dm annotation api][oldAnnotApi]. Notice that the dm runtime is compatible with old and new annotations version, so you can use latest dm annotation runtime and old annotation api.
- removed "dereference" attribute in ServiceDependencyAnnotation, because we can now infer if the service dependency callbacks accepts a ServiceReference or a ServiceObjects parameter

Since some incompatible changes have been made, the major version of the annotation bundle has been bumped to 5.0.0. 

### User defined property types

So far, you could define component service properties using @Property annotation, and component configururation could be declared as user defined interfaces.
You can now declare user-defined annotations which can be used to specify both service properties and component configuration. It means that instead of declaring service properties using @Property annotation, you can now use your own annotations (which must be annotated with the new @PropertyType annotation, or possibly using the standard @ComponentPropertyType annotation). 
### Usage example
Let’s assume your write an OSGi r7 jaxrs servlet context which needs the two following service properties:
 ```
osgi.http.whiteboard.context.name
osgi.http.whiteboard.context.path
```
Then you can first define your own annotation (but you could also reuse the default annotations provided by the new upcomming jaxrs whiteboard r7 api, from the  org.osgi.service.jaxrs.whiteboard.propertytypes package):

```java
import org.apache.felix.dependencymanager.annotation.PropertyType;

 @PropertyType
 @interface ServletContext {
     String osgi_http_whiteboard_context_name() default AppServletContext.NAME;
     String osgi_http_whiteboard_context_path();
 }
 ```
In the above, the underscore is mapped to ".", and you can apply the above annotation on top of your component like this:

```java
 @Component
 @ServletContext(osgi_http_whiteboard_context_path="/game")
 public class AppServletContext extends ServletContextHelper {
 }
  ```
You can also use configuration admin service in order to override the default service properties:
```java
 @Component
 @ServletContext(osgi_http_whiteboard_context_path="/game")
 public class AppServletContext extends ServletContextHelper {
     @ConfigurationDependency(propagate=true, pid="my.pid")
     void updated(ServletContext cnf) {
        // if some properties are not present in the configuration, then the ones used in the
        // annotation will be used.
        // The configuration admin properties, if defined, will override the default configurations
        // defined in the annotations
     }
 }
  ```
  
You can also define multiple property type annotations, and possibly single valued annotation, like it is the case with standard r7 DS. In this case, you can use the standard R7 PREFIX_ constants in order to specify the property prefix, and the property name will be derived from the single valued annotation (using camel case convention):
```java
 @PropertyType
 @interface ContextName { // will map to "osgi.http.whiteboard.context.name" property name
     String PREFIX_="osgi.http.whiteboard.";
     String value();
 }
 
 @PropertyType
 @interface ContextPath { // will map to "osgi.http.whiteboard.context.path" property name
     String PREFIX_="osgi.http.whiteboard.";
     String value();
 }
 
 @Component
 @ContextName(AppServletContext.NAME)
 @ContextPath("/game")
 public class AppServletContext extends ServletContextHelper {
 }
   ```
Same example as above, but also using configuration admin service in order to override default service properties: Here, as in OSGi r7 declarative service, you can define a callback method which accepts as arguments all (or some of) the defined property types:
```java
 @Component
 @ContextName(AppServletContext.NAME)
 @ContextPath("/game")
 public class AppServletContext extends ServletContextHelper {
     @ConfigurationDependency(propagate=true, pid="my.pid")
     void updated(ContextName ctxName, ContextPath ctxPath) {
        // if some properties are not present in the configuration, then the ones used in the annotation will be used.
        // The configuration admin properties, if defined, will override the default configurations defined in the annotations
     }
 }
 ```
 
The following is the same example as above, but this time the configuration callback can also define a Dictionary in the first argument (in case you want to also get the raw configuration dictionary:
```java
 @Component
 @ContextName(AppServletContext.NAME)
 @ContextPath("/game")
 public class AppServletContext extends ServletContextHelper {
     @ConfigurationDependency(propagate=true, pid="my.pid")
     void updated(Dictionary<String, Object> rawConfig, ContextName ctxName) {
        // if some properties are not present in the configuration, then the ones used in the annotation will be used.
        // The configuration admin properties, if defined, will override the default configurations defined in the annotations
     }
 }
 ```

Empty Marker annotations can also be used: when you define an empty annotation, it will be mapped to a java.lang.Boolean property type with Boolean.TRUE value. For example, the following component
will be registered with "osgi.jaxrs.resource" service property with Boolean.TRUE value:

```java
 @PropertyType
 @interface JaxrsResource { // will map to "osgi.jaxrs.resource" property name
     String PREFIX_="osgi.";
 }
 
 @Component(provides = MyResource.class)
 @JaxrsResource     
 public class MyResource {
    @Path(“foo”)
    @GET
    public void getFoo() {
        ...
    }
}
   ```

User defined property types can also be applied on factory components, for example, in the following, the service properties are declared using the user-defined annotations (they will be overriden from the factory configuratin, if present in the config):
```java
@Component(factoryPid="my.factory.pid")
@ContextName(AppServletContext.NAME)
ContextPath("/game")
class Hello implements HelloService {                 
    void updated(ContextName ctxName, ContextPath ctxPath) {
          // Configure or reconfigure our component. the default service 
          // properties will be overriden by the factory configuration (if the
          // service properties are defined in the config)
    }
} 
```
### Not backward compatible annotation changes

This sections describes what has been removed in the annotation api:

- removed FactoryConfigurationAdapterService annotation, which was too verbose. when you need to define some factory pid component, just reuse the @Component annotation and declare the new factoryPid/propagate/updated attributes that have been added in the @Component annotation
- Removed PropertyMetadata annotation: it was related to metatypes, but as of today, osgi metatypes can be defined using standard metatype annotations. No need to support this anymore.
- Removed ResourceAdapterService and ResourceDependency annotations because it was needed to depend on some classes from the dependency manager API. The DM Api should be used directly.
- Removed the following attributes from the Component annotation:
-- FACTORY_NAME
-- FACTORY_INSTANCE
-- factorySet
-- factoryMethod
These attributes were used to be able to create component instances multiple times. Now, simply use factoryPid Component attribute and use standard Configuration Admin in order to instantiate multiple instances of a given service (using factory configuration).
- Removed PropertyMetaData annotation, which was related to osgi metatype. Simply use standard metatype annotation.

## BndTools

the new dependency manager bndtools workspace has been reworked in order to use the latest bndtools 3.5.0, and we are now using the "aQute.bnd.repository.maven.provider.MavenBndRepository" plugin, which allows to download 3rd party libraries from maven central, instead of copying them in the cnf/localrepo/.
Baselining is now using last released artifacts from maven central, and the dependency source tar.gz does not contain any binaries anymore

## Api enhancements
some enhancements have been done in the dm API:
- the api to define aspects and adapters have been reworked (but dm API remains `backward compatible`)
- you can now declare multiple property type interfaces when using Configuration Dependency or Factory Components (this was needed to implement the enhancements for the annotations)
- configuration dependency using metatypes can now declare property types
- Allow to specify if propagated configuration dependencies must override service service properties (it was not possible to override service properties with propagated service properties so far)
- Added the following signatures in Component interface:
  - setInterface(Class<?> serviceName, Dictionary<?,?> properties)
  - setInterface(Class<?>[] serviceNames, Dictionary<?,?> properties)

### Aspect/Adapters Api enhancements

So far, aspects or adapters were defined using many methods from DependencyManager or DependencyActivatorBase classes:

For example, in DependencyManager.java, we have many signatures

```java
public class DependencyManager {
    public Component createAdapterService(Class<?> serviceInterface, String serviceFilter) {...}
    public Component createAdapterService(Class<?> serviceInterface, String serviceFilter, String autoConfig) {...}
    public Component createAdapterService(Class<?> serviceInterface, String serviceFilter, String add, String change, String remove) {...}
    public Component createAdapterService(Class<?> serviceInterface, String serviceFilter, String add, String change, String remove, String swap) {...}
    public Component createAdapterService(Class<?> serviceInterface, String serviceFilter, String autoConfig, Object callbackInstance, String add, String change, String remove, String swap, boolean propagate) {...}
    
    public Component createFactoryConfigurationAdapterService(String factoryPid, String update, boolean propagate) {...}
    public Component createFactoryConfigurationAdapterService(String factoryPid, String update, boolean propagate, Object callbackInstance) {...}
    public Component createFactoryConfigurationAdapterService(String factoryPid, String update, boolean propagate, Class<?> configType) {...}
    public Component createFactoryConfigurationAdapterService(String factoryPid, String update, boolean propagate, Object callbackInstance, Class<?> configType) {...}
    public Component createAdapterFactoryConfigurationService(String factoryPid, String update, boolean propagate,String heading, String desc, String localization, PropertyMetaData[] propertiesMetaData) {...}
    
    public Component createBundleAdapterService(int bundleStateMask, String bundleFilter, boolean propagate) {...}
    public Component createBundleAdapterService(int bundleStateMask, String bundleFilter, boolean propagate, Object callbackInstance, String add, String change, String remove) {...}
    
    public Component createResourceAdapterService(String resourceFilter, boolean propagate, Object callbackInstance, String callbackChanged) {...}
    public Component createResourceAdapterService(String resourceFilter, boolean propagate, Object callbackInstance, String callbackSet, String callbackChanged)
    public Component createResourceAdapterService(String resourceFilter, Object propagateCallbackInstance, String propagateCallbackMethod, Object callbackInstance, String callbackChanged) {...}
    public Component createResourceAdapterService(String resourceFilter, Object propagateCallbackInstance, String propagateCallbackMethod, Object callbackInstance, String callbackSet, String callbackChanged) {...}
    
    public Component createAspectService(Class<?> serviceInterface, String serviceFilter, int ranking, String autoConfig) {...}
    public Component createAspectService(Class<?> serviceInterface, String serviceFilter, int ranking) {...}
    public Component createAspectService(Class<?> serviceInterface, String serviceFilter, int ranking, String add, String change, String remove) {...}
    public Component createAspectService(Class<?> serviceInterface, String serviceFilter, int ranking, String add, String change, String remove, String swap) {...}
    public Component createAspectService(Class<?> serviceInterface, String serviceFilter, int ranking, Object callbackInstance, String add, String change, String remove, String swap) {...}
```

So, in this new release, we have simplified the usage of the aspect/adapters like this: instead of having to use some of the many methods from the DependencyManager or DependencyActivatorBase, we have added some new interfaces for the aspect and adapters, and these interfaces are extending the Component interface. All other existing methods have been moved to DependencyManagerCompat/DependencyActivatorBaseCompat classes and the DependencyManager/DependencyActovatorBase classes are now extending the compat classes: this allows to simplify the reading of the javadocs for DependencyManager/DependencyActovatorBase.

For example, let's first show how an factory pid  component was declared so far (a factory pid component is one which can be instantated multiple times using a "factory configuration" created using standard "configuration admin" service):

```java
public class Activator extends DependencyActivatorBase {
    @Override
    public void init(BundleContext context, DependencyManager dm) throws Exception {
        dm.add(createFactoryConfigurationAdapterService("my.factory.pid", "updated", true, MyConfig.class)
            .setInterface(MyService.class.getName(), null)
            .setImplementation(MyServiceImpl.class)
            .add(createServiceDependency().setService(LogService.class))); // NullObject 
    }
}
```

So, now, there is a new FactoryComponent interface which extends the Component interface and it contains all the various parameters used when declaring a factory pid component. So the example above becomes:

```java
public class Activator extends DependencyActivatorBase {
    @Override
    public void init(BundleContext context, DependencyManager dm) throws Exception {
        dm.add(createFactoryComponent()
            .setFactoryPid("my.factory.pid")
            .setPropagate(true)
            .setConfigType(MyConfig.class)
            .setInterface(MyService.class.getName(), null)
            .setImplementation(MyServiceImpl.class)
            .add(createServiceDependency().setService(LogService.class))); // NullObject 
    }
}
```

now, we explain what the new interfaces look like: Indeed as you can imagine, there is an issue when you extend the Component interface, because the various Component setter methods return a Component type. So, what we would like is to be able to introduce a generic type in the Component interface , and such generic type can then be used to allow the Component setter methods to return not the Component type, but instead return the aspect/adapter sub classes.
This is what we have done, let's show a pseudo code, so you can understand how it works:

First, the Component annotation have been reworked like this:
```java
	public interface Component<T extends Component<T>> {
		T setInterface(String service, Dictionary properties)
		T setImplementation(Object ob);
		...
	}
```
As you can see the Component annotation is now using a recursive generic type which extends the Component interface. And now we have for example the following AdapterComponent interface which is defined like this:

```java
	public interface AdapterComponent extends Component<AdapterComponent> {
		AdapterComponent setAdaptee(Class<?> service, String filter);
		AdapterComponent setAdapteeCallbacks(String add, String change, String remove, String swap);
		...
	}
```
So, now, an adapter component can be defined like this:

```java
Component adapter = createAdapterComponent()
   .setAdaptee(Adaptee.class, "(foo=bar)")
   .setAdapteeCallbacks("setAdaptee", "changeAdaptee", null, null)
   .setImplementation(AdapterImpl.class)
   .setInterface(AdapterService.class, null)
   .add(createServiceDependency().setService(LogService.class));
```

### Support for multiple configuration types in callbacks
The ConfigurationDependency and Factory components can now support updated callbacks with multiple configuration types, for example, the following Activator defines a factory component (using the enhanced api) and multiple configuration types can now be provided:

```java
public class Activator extends DependencyActivatorBase {
    @Override
    public void init(BundleContext context, DependencyManager dm) throws Exception {
        Component factoryComponent = createFactoryComponent()
        	.setFactoryPid(pid).
        	.setConfigType(MyConfig1.class, MyConfig2.class)
        	.setImplementation(MyComponent.class);
        dm.add(factoryComponent);
    }
}

public class MyComponent {
    void updated(MyConfig1 cnf1, MyConfig2 cnf2) { ... }
}
```
Moreover, you can define a Dictionary parameter as the first argument in the updated callback, because sometimes, it's useful to be injected with the raw dictionary configuration, as well as with the configuration types. Example:

```java
public class MyComponent {
    void updated(Dictionary<String, Object> rawConfig, MyConfig1 cnf1, MyConfig2 cnf2) { ... }
}
```
so, the new signatures for the updated callbacks are now the following (for both ConfigurationDependency and Factory Component):

* updated(Dictionary cnf)
* updated(Component comp, Dictionary cnf)
* updated(Component comp, Property interfaces ...)
* updated(Property interfaces ...)
* updated(Dictionary cnf, Property interfaces ...)
* updated(Component comp, Dictionary cnf, Property interfaces ...)

## Support for service scopes

DM now allows to specify scoped services more easily.

From the provider side, a new "scope" parameter has been added in the Component interface, allowing to define the scope of the registered service, and the parameter will have three enum values: SINGLETON, BUNDLE, PROTOTYPE
- SINGLETON: it's as before: your registered service is a singleton
- BUNDLE: the service will be registered as a _ServiceFactory_
- PROTOTYPE: the service will be registered as a _PrototypeServiceFactory_

Scoped Services are supported by all kind of DM service components:
- Component
- Aspect Service
- Adapter Service
- Factory Pid Service
- Bundle Adapter service

When a consumer requests a service (using ServiceDependency), then DM will automatically dereference the service like this:
- if the service has a _SERVICE_SCOPE_ service property matching _SCOPE_PROTOTYPE_, the DM will internally derefence the service using the _ServiceObject_ API: so, the consumer will get its own copy of the requested service instance.
- else, DM will internally dereference the service, as before.

When defining scoped component implementation, you can optionally define two special class fields in order to get injected with the client `Bundle` requesting the service, and the `ServiceRegisgtration` Object. Using the DM API this is enabled by default and you can turn off auto config using `Component.setAutoConfig(Bundle.class, boolean)` method, or `Component.setAutoConfig(ServiceRegistration.class, boolean)` methods. When using annotation, just use @Inject annotations in order to get injected with the client `Bundle` or the `ServiceRegistration`. You can also define a constructor which takes as argument the client bundle as well as the service registration, and in this case auto configuring Bundle/ServiceRegistration in class fields will be disabled. (we will give concrete examples bellow using DM native API and DM annotations).


### Example using annotations

Here is a MyService component with PROTOTYPE scope, each requester will get its own copy of MyService instance, and the MyServiceImpl.start() method will be called for each instance:

```java
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.Component;
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.ServiceScope;

@Component(scope=ServiceScope.PROTOTYPE)
public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
    @Start
    void start() {
        // called on each MyService instance
    }
}
```

The above service will then automatically be instantiated for each service requester:
```java
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.Component;
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.ServiceScope;

@Component
public class Client1 {
    @ServiceDependency
    void bind(MyService service) {
       // Client1 will be injected with its own MyService instance
    }
}

@Component
public class Client2 {
    @ServiceDependency
    void bind(MyService service) {
           // Client2 will be injected with its own MyService instance
    }
}
```
The two Client1/Client2 above will be injected with two distinct component instances for the MyService service (each MyServiceImpl instance will be invoked in its start callback).

Now, if you want to control the creation of the MyService, you can then define a bind method which takes as argument a ServiceObjects<MyService> parameter like this:
```java
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.Component;
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.ServiceScope;

@Component
public static class Client {
    @ServiceDependency
    void bind(ServiceObject<MyService> serviceObjects) {
        MyService service;
        try {
            service = serviceObjects.getService();
        } finally {
            serviceObjects.ungetService(service);
        }
    }
}
```

Internally, DM will use the PrototypeServiceFactory.getService(Bundle clientBundle, ServiceRegistration reg) method in order to instantiate the MyServiceImpl component. So, the MyServiceImpl component can optionally use the @Inject annotation in order to get injected with the clientBundle and/or the service regisration, like this:

```java
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.Component;
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.ServiceScope;

@Component(scope=ServiceScope.PROTOTYPE)
public static class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
   
    @Inject
    Bundle m_clientBundle;
    
    @Inject
    ServiceRegisration m_registration;

    @Start
	void start() {
	   // called on each MyService instance.
	}
}
```

The Bundle and ServiceRegistration can also be injected in the component Constructor:

```java
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.Component;
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.ServiceScope;

@Component(scope=ServiceScope.PROTOTYPE)
public static class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
   
   public MyServiceImpl(Bundle clientBundle, ServiceRegistration registration) { 
      ... 
   }
    
   @Start
   void start() {
	   // called on each MyService instance.
	}
}
```
### Example using DM API
This section shows an example usage of scoped services using the DM native API. 

#### Simple example
So, here is a MyService component with PROTOTYPE scope, and each requester will get its own copy of MyService instance (the MyServiceImpl.start() method will be called for each MyServiceImpl instance):

```java
public class Activator extends DependencyActivatorBase {
    @Override
    public void init(BundleContext context, DependencyManager dm) throws Exception {
        dm.add(createComponent()
            .setScope(ServiceScope.PROTOTYPE)
            .setInterface(MyService.class.getName(), null)
            .setImplementation(MyServiceImpl.class));
    }
}

public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
    void start() {
        // called on each MyService instance
    }
}
```

The MyServiceImpl, like with annotations, can define a constructor in order to be injected with the client bundle invoking the service and also the service Registration:

```java
public class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
    public MyServiceImpl(Bundle clientBundle, ServiceRegistration reg) { ... }
    void start() {
        // called on each MyService instance
    }
}
```

(if you want to auto configure the client Bundle, and the ServiceRegistration, then simply define class fields, they will be auto injected, unless you disable auto configuraiton for Bundle/ServiceRegistration using Component.setAutoConfig(Class, boolean) methods.

Hre is a Client component which simply depends on the MyService service using a basic DM activator (nothing special to do):
```java
public class Activator extends DependencyActivatorBase {
    @Override
    public void init(BundleContext context, DependencyManager dm) throws Exception {
        dm.add(createComponent()
            .setImplementation(Client.class)
            .add(createServiceDependency()
                 .setService(MyService.class, null).setRequired(true).setCallbacks("bind", "unbind"));
    }
}

public class Client {
    void bind(MyService service) {
        // our client is injected with a specific instance of the MyService component 
        // that is created for our Client.
        // If another component defines a service dependency on MyService, then the other 
        // component will get its own private copy of MyService component instance
    }
}
```

#### Example using ServiceObjects API

If now you want to control the creation of the MyService using raw OSGI ServiceObjects API, you can also do it like this:
```java
public class Client {
    void bind(ServiceObjects<MyService> so) {
        MyService s1 = so.getService();
        MyService s2 = so.getService();
        ...
        so.ungetService(s1); // will deactivate the MyService s1 instance
        so.ungetService(s2); // will deactivate the MyService s2 instance
    }
}
```

#### Scoped services and init/destroy callbacks.

When you need to specify dynamic dependencies from your component.init() method, the following mechanism will be used:

- first, if your component defines an init callback, then one single component `prototype instance` singleton is created, as it the component is declared with SCOPE=SINGLETON.
- so, the prototype instance will be invoked in the init callback, but won't be started or stopped
- and when all dependencies are satisfied (including the dynamic dependencies), then the ServiceFactory (or PrototypeServiceFactory) is registered
- so, when one client will request a component instance, then a clone will be created, but the clone won't be invoked in the init() method, it will only be called in the start() callback (after having been injected with all dependencies declared in the prototype instance init method).

Example of a scoped component which defines an init method:

```java
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.Component;
import org.apache.felix.dm.annotation.api.ServiceScope;

@Component(scope=ServiceScope.PROTOTYPE)
public static class MyServiceImpl implements MyService {
   
   @Init
   void init(Component comp) {
        // add dependencies dynamically: take care this method is only invoked on the prototype instance, not on clones
   }

    @Start
	void start() {
	   // called on each clone, not on the prototype instance singleton
	}
	
	@Stop
	void stop() {
	   // called on each clone, not on the prototype instance singleton
	}
}
```

#### Limitation when using DM ServiceDependency from API and ServiceObjects

When using DependencyManager ServiceDependency from the `native API` (not using annotations), you have to know that the ServiceDependency always internally dereferences and creates the scoped service using ServiceObjects.getService() method, even if you specify a ServiceObjecs parameter in your bind method.
If now you really want to disable the auto-deref ServiceDependency (because you want to directly use the ServiceObjects API), you must then use the "setDereference(false") method on your ServiceDependency: in this way, you tell DM to never dereference internally the scoped service. Here is an example:

```java
public class Activator extends DependencyActivatorBase {
    @Override
    public void init(BundleContext context, DependencyManager dm) throws Exception {
        dm.add(createComponent()
            .setImplementation(Client.class)
            .add(createServiceDependency()
                 .setService(MyService.class, null).setRequired(true).setCallbacks("bind", "unbind")
                 .setDereference(false));
    }
}

public class Client {
    void bind(ServiceObjects<MyService> so) {
        MyService s1 = so.getService();
        MyService s2 = so.getService();
        ...
        so.ungetService(s1); // will deactivate the MyService s1 instance
        so.ungetService(s2); // will deactivate the MyService s2 instance
    }
}
```
In the above example, the Activator defines the ServiceDependency using the ServiceDependency.setDereference(false) method because it's the Client.bind method which will create the MyService instances manually.

In the future, I will try to auto detect the signatures of the Client.bind method in order to never auto-dereference the injected service in case the bind method takes as argument a ServiceObjects (or a ServiceReference) method.

# Bug fixed

- fixed a nasty deadlock when using latest DM r11 and latest SCR 2.0.12 in the same JVM (see FELIX-5716)
- The DM core bundle is now importing org.osgi.framework with version range "[1.8, 2)"

# TODO

## Add more signatures in configuration callbacks
The ConfigurationDependency and Factory component updated method currently supports the following method signatures:
 * updated(Dictionary cnf)
 * updated(Component comp, Dictionary cnf)
 * updated(Component comp, Property interfaces ...)
 * updated(Property interfaces ...)
 * updated(Dictionary cnf, Property interfaces ...)
 * updated(Component comp, Dictionary cnf, Property interfaces ...)

So, maybe it would make sense to also add the two following signatures:

* updated(Map cnf, Property interfaces ...)
* updated(Component comp, Map cnf, Property interfaces ...)
