/**
 * Annotates an OSGi Component class with its dependencies. Components are the main building 
 * blocks for OSGi applications. They can publish themselves as a service, and/or they can have 
 * dependencies. These dependencies will influence their life cycle as component will only be 
 * activated when all required dependencies are available. 
 * By default, all directly implemented interfaces are registered into the OSGi registry,
 * and the component is instantiated automatically, when the component bundle is started and 
 * when the component dependencies are available. If you need to take control of when and how 
 * much component instances must be created, then you can use the <code>factoryName</code> 
 * annotation attribute.<p> 
 * If a <code>factoryPid</code> attribute is set, the component is not started automatically 
 * during bundle startup, and the component can then be instantiated multiple times using
 * Configuration Admin "Factory Configurations".
 *
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 * 
 * Here is a sample showing a Hello component, which depends on a configuration dependency:
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &#47;**
 *   * This component will be activated once the bundle is started and when all required dependencies
 *   * are available.
 *   *&#47;
 * &#64;Component
 * class Hello implements HelloService {
 *     &#64;ConfigurationDependency(pid="my.pid")
 *     void configure(Dictionary conf) {
 *          // Configure or reconfigure our component.
 *     }
 *   
 *     &#64;Start
 *     void start() {
 *         // Our component is starting and is about to be registered in the OSGi registry as a Z service.
 *     }   
 * }
 * </pre>
 * </blockquote>
 * 
 * Here is a sample showing how a HelloFactory component may dynamically instantiate several Hello component instances, 
 * using Configuration Admin "Factory Configurations":
 * <blockquote>
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  &#47;**
 *    * All component instances will be created/updated/removed by the "HelloFactory" component
 *    *&#47;
 *  &#64;Component(factoryPid="my.factory.pid")
 *  class Hello implements HelloService {                 
 *      void updated(Dictionary conf) {
 *          // Configure or reconfigure our component. The conf is provided by the factory,
 *      }
 *       
 *      &#64;Start
 *      void start() {
 *          // Our component is starting and is about to be registered in the OSGi registry as a Hello service.
 *      }       
 *  } 
 *
 *  &#47;**
 *    * This class will instantiate some Hello component instances
 *    *&#47;
 *  &#64;Component 
 *  class HelloFactory {
 *     &#64;ServiceDependency
 *     void bind(ConfigurationAdmin cm) {
 *          // instantiate a first instance of Hello component
 *          Configuration c1 = cm.createFactoryConfiguration("my.factory.pid", "?");
 *          Hashtable props = new Hashtable();
 *          newprops.put("key", "value1");
 *          c1.update(props);
 *          
 *          // instantiate another instance of Hello component
 *          Configuration c2 = cm.createFactoryConfiguration("my.factory.pid", "?");
 *          props = new Hashtable();
 *          newprops.put("key", "value2");
 *          c2.update(props);
 *          
 *          // destroy the two instances of X component
 *          c1.delete();
 *          c2.delete();
 *     }
 *  }
 * </pre>
