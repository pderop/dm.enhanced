/**
 * Interface used to configure the various parameters needed when defining 
 * a Dependency Manager adapter component.
 * 
 * Adapters, like {@link AspectComponent}, are used to "extend" 
 * existing services, and can publish different services based on the existing one. 
 * An example would be implementing a management interface for an existing service, etc .... 
 * <p>When you create an adapter component, it will be applied 
 * to any service that matches the implemented interface and filter. The adapter will be registered 
 * with the specified interface and existing properties from the original service plus any extra 
 * properties you supply here. If you declare the original service as a member it will be injected.
 * 
 * <h3>Usage Examples</h3>
 * 
 * Here is a sample showing a HelloServlet adapter component which creates an servlet each time a HelloService is registered in the
 * osgi service registry with the "foo=bar" service property.
 * 
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * {@code
 * public class Activator extends DependencyActivatorBase {
 *     &Override
 *     public void init(BundleContext context, DependencyManager dm) throws Exception {
 *         Component adapterComponent = createAdapterComponent()
 *             .setAdaptee(HelloService.class, "(foo=bar)")
 *             .setInterface(HttpServlet.class.getName(), null)
 *             .setImplementation(HelloServlet.class);
 *         dm.add(adapterComponent);
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * public interface HelloService {
 *     String sayHello();
 * }
 * 
 * public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
 *     volatile HelloService adatpee;
 *     
 *     void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse resp) {
 *         ...
 *         resp.getWriter().println(adaptee.sayHello());
 *     }
 * }
 * } </pre></blockquote>
 * 
 * <p> When you use callbacks to get injected with the adaptee service, the "add", "change", "remove" callbacks
 * support the following method signatures:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference ref, Service service)
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference ref, Object service)
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference ref)
 * (Component comp, Service service)
 * (Component comp, Object service)
 * (Component comp)
 * (Component comp, Map properties, Service service)
 * (ServiceReference ref, Service service)
 * (ServiceReference ref, Object service)
 * (ServiceReference ref)
 * (Service service)
 * (Service service, Map propeerties)
 * (Map properties, Service, service)
 * (Service service, Dictionary properties)
 * (Dictionary properties, Service service)
 * (Object service)
 * }</pre>
 * 
 * <p> For "swap" callbacks, the following method signatures are supported:
 * 
 * <pre>{@code
 * (Service old, Service replace)
 * (Object old, Object replace)
 * (ServiceReference old, Service old, ServiceReference replace, Service replace)
 * (ServiceReference old, Object old, ServiceReference replace, Object replace)
 * (Component comp, Service old, Service replace)
 * (Component comp, Object old, Object replace)
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference old, Service old, ServiceReference replace, Service replace)
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference old, Object old, ServiceReference replace, Object replace)
 * (ServiceReference old, ServiceReference replace)
 * (Component comp, ServiceReference old, ServiceReference replace)
 * }</pre>
